                <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="My Photo" class="mypic">
                <p class="long-copy">I am Sherin, 29 years old and mom to my two-year-old daughter. Among my interests are reading, travelling, baking and spending time with my family and friends. I love nature and feel that it is our responsibility to nurture it. I believe that simplicity is real beauty.</p>

                <h2>Why I Love Coding</h2>
               
                <p class="long-copy">I worked as a programmer for a while at Tata Consultancy Services in India, in a very different technology - Mainframe. During that time, I realised that I love coding and seeing my programs execute gave immense satisfaction. But there was something missing. Mainframe is a bit limited in an artistic sense, if what you want to do is to create beauty and not extensive reports and account summaries for banks. After about four years of work, I got married and my husband and I migrated to Australia with our then six months old daughter in 2016. This maternity break was ideal for me to start thinking about doing something that I would really enjoy. I thought about doing courses to qualify for various jobs such as a teacher, a scientist, an admin and even an architect! But somehow my heart always came back to coding and specifically web development. Below are a few of my reasons.  </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col span-1-of-4">
                    <img src="images/flower.png" class="desc-icon">
                    <h3>The beauty of it!</h3>
                    <p class="desc">Creativity is a joy to the beholder. When I see a beautifully made website or an imaginative animation, I always wonder what goes behind it and what makes them work. Watching a bunch of computer code turn into a thing of beauty is amazing.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="col span-1-of-4">
                    <img src="images/books.png" class="desc-icon">
                    <h3>Learning new things</h3>
                    <p class="desc">I have always enjoyed the challenge of learning something new that interests me. My dabbling in web development took a serious turn when I attended a short course in basic HTML & CSS during my maternity break. Now, there is a list of languages that I am eager and curious to learn.</p>

                    <h3>Flexibility</h3>
                    <p class="desc">One aspect that I look for in my job in the long-term is work life balance. From my chats with a few web developers, I understood that they enjoy their work due to flexible work hours and choice of work locations. As a mother, this is a real attraction for me. </p>

                    <img src="images/social.png" class="desc-icon">
                    <h3>Social Cause</h3>
                    <p class="desc">Non-profit organizations usually have a limited budget that leads them to compromise on the design of their websites. However, an attractive website is crucial for the interest of any organization. I look forward to volunteering for such organisations for enhancing their online presence.</p>

                <h2>My Interests</h2>
                
                <p class="long-copy">I admire creativity, beauty and nature. My interests are influenced mainly by these aspects. I would rather go for a walk in the park than to a shopping mall. Web development interests me due to the opportunity to blend logic and creativity! </p>

                    <h3>Healthy Lifestyle</h3>
                    <p class="desc">Proper sleep, wholesome food and adequate exercise are what I think occupy the menu to a healthy life. I  practice yoga and meditation. In this era of electronic entertainment devices, we need to instill an interest in outdoor activities and nature in our kids for creating a healthy young generation.</p>

                    <h3>Children's Welfare</h3>
                    <p class="desc">I find the plight of disadvantaged children in our society very moving and distressing. In developing countries, the girl child is especially sidelined. I used to sponsor a girl child’s education via World Vision when I was working. I look forward to doing much more when I start earning again.</p>

                    <h3>Travelling</h3>
                    <p class="desc">I like exploring new places. Getting to know about the culture, food and nature of different countries is exciting. There is so much to learn and do in this world. Every destination has something unique to teach visitors and getting immersed in a different world is the best learning experience. </p>

                    <h3>Nature</h3>
                    <p class="desc">Our Earth is full of wonders and we are responsible for preserving them. I believe that we should live in a way inflicting as little damage as possible to our planet, which implies recycling all that we can, growing greens with the compost made from kitchen waste, making minimum use of plastics and more. </p>

                    <p class="desc">Though a total amateur, I love it when the light, angle and the subject align in perfect harmony to create a beautiful picture. A photograph is a moment in our story kept forever. It is a form of art that can transport someone to a different place and time.</p>
